# Bash

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is an interpreter in the CLI (Terminal) and a scripting language that serves as the default shell on most Linux distros. It provides both an interactive interface for executing commands and a scripting environment for automation tasks. 

> [!NOTE]
> - Shell is basically a program which runs inside of our Terminal (CLI), for e.g. bash, zsh etc.
> - Any command that we type in the terminal, Shell like Bash will interpret and execute it. Also if we write any Bash script and execute it in a Bash compatible shell like bash, zsh, etc. If we execute the same bash script in some other Shell which does not support Bash sciript syntax, it will not work

Generally, commands follow this syntax -> `command [OPTIONS] arguments`
